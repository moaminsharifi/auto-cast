- **npm** or **pnpm** (we recommend pnpm)
- **Git** for version control
- **OpenAI API Key** for testing AI features

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/auto-cast.git
   cd auto-cast
   ```

3. **Add the upstream repository**:

   git remote add upstream https://github.com/moaminsharifi/auto-cast.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or

## üõ†Ô∏è Making Changes

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Update your fork with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
# or for documentation
git checkout -b docs/documentation-update
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Make your changes** in small, logical commits
2. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   # Type checking
   npm run type-check
   
   # Linting
   npm run lint
   
   # Build test
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Test the application manually**:
   - Try all 4 steps of the podcast generation workflow
   - Test with different settings and configurations
   - Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
   - Test both light and dark themes

4. **Write or update tests** if applicable
5. **Update documentation** if you've made changes to APIs or user interface

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Code Style

We use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code formatting. Please ensure your code passes linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### TypeScript Guidelines

- **Use strict TypeScript** - avoid `any` types
- **Define interfaces** for component props and API responses
- **Use proper typing** for event handlers and callbacks
- **Document complex types** with JSDoc comments

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface VoiceSettings {
  /** Primary voice for single-host or first speaker */
  primaryVoice: string
  /** Secondary voice for dual-host conversations */
  secondaryVoice?: string
  /** Speech rate multiplier (0.5-2.0) */
  speed: number
  /** Pitch adjustment multiplier (0.8-1.2) */
  pitch: number
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
const settings: any = { ... }
```

### React Component Guidelines

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **Prefer composition** over inheritance
- **Use meaningful prop names** and provide defaults
- **Add proper JSDoc comments** for component props

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface ButtonProps {
  /** Button text content */
  children: React.ReactNode
  /** Button variant style */
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline'
  /** Whether button is in loading state */
  isLoading?: boolean
  /** Click event handler */
  onClick?: () => void
}

export default function Button({ 
  children, 
  variant = 'primary', 
  isLoading = false, 
  onClick 
}: ButtonProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### CSS and Styling

- **Use Tailwind CSS** classes primarily
- **Follow mobile-first** responsive design
- **Support dark mode** with appropriate classes
- **Use consistent spacing** following the 4px grid system

```jsx
// ‚úÖ Good
<div className="
  p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8
  bg-white dark:bg-slate-900
  rounded-lg shadow-sm
  transition-colors duration-200
">
```

```

### Component Organization

- **One component per file** with default export
- **Co-locate related files** (component + test + styles)
- **Use barrel exports** for component groups
- **Separate UI components** from business logic

### State Management

- **Local state** for component-specific data
- **Local storage** for user preferences
- **URL state** for shareable application state
- **Context** sparingly for truly global state

## üß™ Testing

Before submitting changes, please test:

- [ ] **Podcast generation workflow** - All 4 steps complete successfully

- [ ] **Theme switching** - Light and dark modes
- [ ] **Error handling** - Invalid inputs and network errors
- [ ] **Audio playback** - Voice samples and generated podcasts
- [ ] **File upload** - Text and markdown file handling

### Automated Testing

We encourage adding tests for:
- **Component behavior** - User interactions and state changes
